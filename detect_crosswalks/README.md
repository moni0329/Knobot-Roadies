# Detect Crosswalks

The following mentioned functional requirements are addressed in this directory.

1. **Detect Crosswalks**: Utilizes a YOLOv5 model to detect crosswalks using satellite images and a camera module.

## Structure

- `CWtrain/`: Google Colab notebook containing the codes for training the YOLOv5 model for detecting crosswalks.
- `CWModelTEST/`:  Google Colab notebook containing the codes testing the trained model for one image.
- `CWevaluation/`:  Google Colab containing the codes for validating the trained model.

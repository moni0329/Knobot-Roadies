The following mentioned functional requirements are addressed in this directory.

1. **Detect Pedestrian traffic lights**: Utilizes a YOLOv5 model to detect Pedestrian traffic light signal using a camera module.

## Structure

- `TLBEST/`: Google Colab notebook containing the codes for training the YOLOv5 model for detecting pedestrian traffic lights.
- `TLModelTEST/`:  Google Colab notebook containing the codes testing the trained model for one image.
- `TLevaluation/`:  Google Colab containing the codes for validating the trained model.
